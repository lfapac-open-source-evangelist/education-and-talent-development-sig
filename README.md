# Education and Talent Development SIG

The Education Special Interest Group (SIG) is a group of experts, staff, and members interested in open source education and open source talent development. SIGs are not official organisations and include members of the Linux Foundation, but most members are not members of the Foundation. Membership roles are more volunteer oriented, informal, and self-directed, and often involve experts and activists from business and the community. The vitality of the SIG depends largely on the active participation and commitment of its members. More information can be found in [Introduction to the Education SIG](https://evangelists.linuxfoundation.cn/sigs/education) and [SIG Charter](CHARTER.md).

Education 特别兴趣小组 （SIG） 是由对开源教育以及开源人才培养感兴趣的专家、工作人员和成员组成的小组。特别兴趣小组不是官方组织，有 Linux 基金会成员参与，但大部分成员都并非基金会成员。成员角色偏向志愿者，更为非正式、自我导向，通常涉及来自企业、社区的专家和积极分子。该 SIG 的生命力主要取决于其成员的积极参与和承诺。更多信息可以参考 [开源教育 SIG 介绍](https://evangelists.linuxfoundation.cn/sigs/education) 以及 [SIG 章程](CHARTER.md)。
